# Dotfiles

# Installation (MacOS)
---

Run the _install.sh_ file from within the _dotfiles_ directory.
It will install all Homebrew dependencies and symlink all needed files.

```shell
bash install.sh
```

---

Install Homebrew packages
---
This command uses the `homebrew/leaves.txt` file to list the needed packages.

```shell
xargs brew install < ./homebrew/leaves.txt
```

## Symlink files into the `~` directory using stow:

Make sure to install [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

```shell
brew install stow
```
Then symnlink the files to the home dir `~`

```shell
stow -vt ~ .
```

You can use the `--simulate`/`-n` option to simulate operations to view the results.

You might need to ignore the `.DS_Store` file by adding `--ignore=DS_Store`.
